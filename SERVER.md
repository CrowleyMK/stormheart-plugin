STORMHEART is a heavily modified Minecraft server. 
Our team strives to have the most immersive survival experience for players.
Created in 2016 it is a fairly new server, the original project [CORE](http://www.corruptioncraft.org) was abandoned late 2012.
During the closure the community has helped come together to help create a new experience for incomming players.

This project is built off the framework [Spigot](https://github.com/SpigotMC), it is a modification of the original [CraftBukkit](https://github.com/Bukkit) project, just made more efficient.
Now, Spigot is an implementation and continuation of the Bukkit API which has been the leading API for Minecraft servers.
STORMHEART also features the [HeroCraft API](https://github.com/Herocraft) for it's well designed class based system.
We are so glad this project has gained such a large following, and we will continue to add new features for players to explore.
